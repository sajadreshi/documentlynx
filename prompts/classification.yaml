  ## Questions to Classify
  {questions_json}

instruction: |
  For each question, provide classification in the following categories:

  1. **topic** (required): The primary subject area. Choose ONE from:
     - math, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, history, geography, 
     - english, literature, economics, computer_science, art, music, 
     - philosophy, sociology, political_science, environmental_science, other

  2. **subtopic** (required): A more specific area within the subject. Examples:
     - Math: algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, trigonometry, number_theory
     - Physics: mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, quantum
     - Chemistry: organic, inorganic, physical, biochemistry, analytical
     - Biology: genetics, ecology, anatomy, microbiology, evolution

  3. **difficulty** (required): The difficulty level. Choose ONE from:
     - easy: Basic recall, simple concepts
     - medium: Application of concepts, moderate complexity
     - hard: Analysis, synthesis, complex problem-solving

  4. **grade_level** (required): The appropriate educational level. Examples:
     - "elementary" (grades 1-5)
     - "middle_school" (grades 6-8)
     - "high_school" (grades 9-12)
     - "undergraduate"
     - "graduate"
     - Or specific grade like "8" for 8th grade

  5. **cognitive_level** (required): Based on Bloom's Taxonomy. Choose ONE from:
     - knowledge: Recall facts and basic concepts
     - comprehension: Understand and explain ideas
     - application: Use information in new situations
     - analysis: Draw connections, compare, contrast
     - synthesis: Create new ideas, design solutions
     - evaluation: Justify decisions, critique

  6. **tags** (required): Array of 3-5 relevant keywords for search. Be specific.

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON array with classification for each question. Match by question_id.

  ```json
  [
    {
      "question_id": "uuid-string",
      "topic": "math",
      "subtopic": "geometry",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "grade_level": "8",
      "cognitive_level": "application",
      "tags": ["area", "triangles", "2D shapes", "measurement"]
    }
  ]
  ```

output_constraints:
  - Output ONLY the JSON array, no additional text
  - Match each classification by question_id
  - Include all 6 required fields for each question
